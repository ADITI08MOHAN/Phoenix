        <h2 class="featurette-heading">ABOUT PHOENIX <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
        <p class="lead">“In order to rise from its own ashes, A PHOENIX must burn.” On 20th September 2005, six incredible minds came together with a burning ambition in their eyes and formed the student society associated with the department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PHOENIX. 


          “In theory, practice is simple but is it simple to practice theory?” The vision of this society has always been to provide a platform to students on which they can enhance their practical knowledge, gain valuable experience in the industrial arena and keep in touch with the ever changing industry and trends. The basic aim of this society is to trigger new minds by giving them an insight into the latest technologies and advancements by organizing technical seminars conducted by distinguished personalities, workshops on various technical developments and organizing various technical events for students in the college.
          
          
          This society kick started its journey by organizing an Electronics Quiz. With this the society extended its reach by conducting regular and informative events. As the society grows old, new minds and new ideas keep on flowing in , making the roots stronger and steadier. With a stable guidance in the society, it has been making a constructive and upbeat impact on the students.
          
          
          In 2006-07, the major hits were the Rover, Radix and the Instant Khichari held at the intra-college tech fest “TECH@VIBRATIONS’06" and the strength of society increased to 28 volunteers and co-ordinators. In 2007-08, the robotics event “Robonoid" organised by the society in “TECH TRISHNA'08"- was the most popular technical event in the history of college. Taking forward the name and crossing the milestone , Phoenix kept its journey on by conducting 'Ecrire de conquirer'- an online technical article writing competition. The articles with the maximum likes were rewarded. As always the event On Board Quiz was a big hit. The event VIBEQUP-“Visual Buzzing and Entertaining Quiz of Puzzles was admired by all attracting intense participation. The final round held at amphitheatre gave an all way round fun and frolic entertainment to all with its multi-layered process.
          
          
          Together with Samveg and Oorja, Phoenix conducted Robotrix classes to give a fundamental understanding of basic concepts involved in designing a robot. Keeping its statistics consistent – Robofestinate, organised during tech trishna'13 was again a great success. The other events organised during tech fest were Identomyst and Series parallel, which were equally appreciated and included mind tickling questions based on basic electrical and electronics engineering.
          
          Phoenix has always been the one to welcome curious and diligent minds, therefore every year in February new students with genuine curiosity and thirst of knowledge are recruited and are trained under various domains of their interest. In the year 2020, when everything went haywire because of the pandemic, Phoenix didn’t lose its zeal. And phoenix found a way to train the new recruits through online mode. Seminars were also conducted online. Team phoenix never stops no matter what the hurdle is because a dream does not become reality through magic, it takes sweat determination and diligence.</p>

        <p class="lead">Just like rainbow is a troupe of different and variant colour, Phoenix is also a blend of knowledge, fun and practicality, which is clearly visible in the events organised by our society.

          Starting with the most convivial event, DESOTRIX which gets a huge number of participants and is a two days event. On the first day fun quizzes and games are organised whereas on the second day technical activities are conducted. 
         
         
         Coming up next is the informative and interactive seminar conducted by our society, ROBOVERSE. Curious students with open minds attend this seminar with full zeal. This session is divided into two halves. First half teaches about the types of robots and their working. On the other hand, second half gives information on microcontroller and microprocessor. At the end of this seminar students are being introduced to the physical parts of the robots and the microcontrollers so that they can have a touch of practicality. 
         
         Next comes the most prominent event conducted by PHOENIX which is ROBORACE. ROBORACE is the part of AKTU ZONALS, in which various teams from different colleges of AKTU, participate. Every team has to bring their own bots to compete against each other in this race. Every year the track is designed and created in AKGEC by team phoenix.
